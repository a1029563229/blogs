# 10 Tricks You Must Know about Cursor

Cursor is currently the most popular AI code editor, no one else. Now, I'll teach you the 10 most important tricks about Cursor.

Firstly, I have to admit that I gave up using VsCode once I came across Cursor. It is becoming in increasingly more useful than VsCode.

Although Cursor has a similar user interface to VSCode, it has integrated many AI features that can make your work more efficient.

## Discard Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V

In the past, the most important keymaps for programmers were undoubtedly Ctrl+C(copy) and Ctrl+V(paste). They could complete many tasks with them even without fully understanding the functionality of the code snippets they were working with.

Now, I'll tell you that you can discard the keymaps of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V with the help of Cursor. Perhaps you may find it hard to believe what I'm saying, but you just need to give it a try after I demonstrate it to you.

I'll prepare an example of a table to show you the magic of Cursor. First of all, I have prepared an image that looks as follows.

Now, I'll restore the image into a web page without writing a single line of code manually.

Firstly, I created a new file named `test.html`, then I opened the AI panel of Cursor that looks like the following image.

Next, I clicked the icon named `image` to upload the image which was referred to. Then I entered my requestments to restore the image into the `test.html`.

In a short while, you can see the code snippets were generated by the latest AI LLM, looking like the following image.

Now, you just need to click the button named `apply` and you'll see the code snippets directly applied to the `test.html`. Then you can review the contents of the advice from AI and click the `Accept file` button to apply the modifications after you have confirmed the content. It looks like the following image.

The code implementation seems quite resonable. Let's start comparing the web page and the original image. I also wonder how it is. Look at the following image.

As we can see, the effect of all the elements was restored very nicely and it has even used the `sub` tag to implement the effect of the `AP` title. I didn't even know that tag before. Although all the elements were restored on the web page, there were still some imperfect aspects: font-style, background-color. But don't worry about that, we can still modify the file with the AI chat of Cursor.

Enter our requirements again and apply the advice from AI. It looks like the following image.

At last we can see that the web page is at least 90 per cent similar to the image.

> Mark: It didn't directly get the final effect that we expected. I corrected it again for about 2-3 times. I didn't show that for the reason of article length.

As we can see, I didn't write a single line of code, but I have drawn a web page using Vue.js.

## Restore high-fidelity without coding

I think that I have already demonstrated this feature in the above section, so I needn't demonstrate it again.
