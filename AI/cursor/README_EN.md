Cursor is currently the most popular AI code editor, no one else. Now, I'll teach you the 7 most important tricks about Cursor.

Firstly, I have to admit that I gave up using VsCode once I came across Cursor. It is becoming in increasingly more useful than VsCode.

Although Cursor has a similar user interface to VSCode, it has integrated many AI features that can make your work more efficient.

## Discard Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V

In the past, the most important keymaps for programmers were undoubtedly Ctrl+C(copy) and Ctrl+V(paste). They could complete many tasks with them even without fully understanding the functionality of the code snippets they were working with.

Now, I'll tell you that you can discard the keymaps of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V with the help of Cursor. Perhaps you may find it hard to believe what I'm saying, but you just need to give it a try after I demonstrate it to you.

I'll prepare an example of a table to show you the magic of Cursor. First of all, I have prepared an image that looks as follows.

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/2d5e4e8c01fb25d9db69d609df4ad0bf.jpg)

Now, I'll restore the image into a web page without writing a single line of code manually.

Firstly, I created a new file named `test.html`, then I opened the AI panel of Cursor that looks like the following image. 

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/0510d045fe359d4e2d2f41aa8c515990.jpg)

Next, I clicked the icon named `image` to upload the image which was referred to. Then I entered my requestments to restore the image into the `test.html`.

In a short while, you can see the code snippets were generated by the latest AI LLM, looking like the following image. 

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/06bcf1b84916127bef7ffd542d97787b.jpg)

Now, you just need to click the button named `apply` and you'll see the code snippets directly applied to the `test.html`. Then you can review the contents of the advice from AI and click the `Accept file` button to apply the modifications after you have confirmed the content. It looks like the following image.

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/b3eb2eecb323003121d8ff765c5f7563.jpg)

The code implementation seems quite resonable. Let's start comparing the web page and the original image. I also wonder how it is. Look at the following image.

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/0bbd8be7d050aa7f1ff929b9bad51384.jpg)

As we can see, the effect of all the elements was restored very nicely and it has even used the `sub` tag to implement the effect of the `AP` title. I didn't even know that tag before. Although all the elements were restored on the web page, there were still some imperfect aspects: font-style, background-color. But don't worry about that, we can still modify the file with the AI chat of Cursor.

Enter our requirements again and apply the advice from AI. It looks like the following image.

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/a5c9b3b35986dcfb4d139f884c37f20f.jpg)

At last we can see that the web page is at least 90 per cent similar to the image.

> Mark: It didn't directly achieve the final effect that we expected. I corrected it again for about 2-3 times. I didn't show that for the reason of article length.

As we can see, I didn't write a single line of code, but I have drawn a web page using Vue.js.

## Restore high-fidelity without coding

I think that I have already demonstrated this feature in the above section, so I needn't demonstrate it again.

## Predict your next focus

In the past, some of the AI coding tools such as copilot could only complete the code that followed your programing path.

The Cursor can predict the next line of code you expected and it can also predict your focus that just looks like it's thinking about what you are thinking.

Let me show you an example to explain it. I'm going to remove the row named 'fps', so I first remove the 'fps' line from the first record of the array. Then the `tab` sign has appeared and I can press the `tab` key to directly move the focus to the next line that I want to go to. It looks like the following image.

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/223ef653e92eee35a7b898bb4cd7cbfc.jpg)

It's a simple demonstration. The complicated scene is that you can press the 'tab' key continuously until the project is finished. I don't have the `GIF` to show you what it looks like. I recommend that you probably give it a try by yourself.

## Smart Rewrites

There is a useful feature on Cursor named `Smart Rewrites`. It can make you more relaxed in strict code writing even if you have forgotten many things you have learned before.

Let me show you how it works. I enter many codes with many syntax errors that can't even be called `code`. It looks like the following image.

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/97f4909a7fc4c93a76faa7307789eb84.jpg)

When I keep my cursor on it and press the `tab` key, then magic has occured. The error codes are all fixed!

Did you have a memory that an error made you annoyed for a day and you finally found it was caused by a simple spelling error of a word? Now, with Cursor, it can help us find the spelling errors easily in our codes. You'll never be annoyed by this.

## Agent

There is another feature that can make your work more efficient. It is Agent.

We can tell it what we want, then it will stand from the perspective of the whole project to help us finish the job.

I want to show you a real example.

I'm recently working on an international project and there are many pieces of work about translation I need to do.

In the past, I needed to finish the `i18n` config file first and then I needed to refer to those config files.

I have to say that is an inefficient work mode. I need to switch the files between business codes and config files. It makes me very annoyed. 

Today I can work on the international project as a normal project. I can finish my coding work first and then throw it to `Agent` of Cursor.

I just need to click the `apply` button step by step. It's very easy, isn't it?

You can use the `Agent` feature if you want to do something that considers the situation from the perspective of the whole project.

## Generate specific code

There is a common feature that needs to be introduced. It's specific code generation.

In the past, if I wanted to write a regular rule about Email, I had to write it manually or search it on the internet.

Now, you can just press the key combination of `Ctrl + K` in any space area in Cursor.

Then a chat popover appears. You can input the requirements, and it will complete the code you need.

![image](http://shadows-mall.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/images/9b15dbb436124a38f18edaf5366b440a.jpg)

It's very useful in our daily work scene.

## Chat everywhere

There is also a feature in Cursor which can make your work efficient.

We can select the code snippets which we are concerned about and then ask it some questions.

The difference between the Cursor and LLM is that you can directly ask the questions in Cursor instead of copying your code snippets to the LLM and then copying the answer to replace your code snippets.

The Cursor will output the answer that is based on your questions and you can click the `apply` button to apply it to your project.

## Summary

The above are all tricks about Cursor that I have known and usually used.

In spite of these, there are still many tricks I haven't referred to. You can learn them through the following article which is from Cursor's official website.
